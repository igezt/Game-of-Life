# Game-of-Life

Uses Jpanel to create a 2d panel that simulates Conway's game of life according to the following rules:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

You can add and remove cells and pause or begin the simulation.
